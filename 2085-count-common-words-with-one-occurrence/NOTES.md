# Using Python Counter Objects

```py
class Solution:
    def countWords(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> int:
        w1, w2 = Counter(words1), Counter(words2)
        count = 0
        for i in words1:
            if w1[i] == 1 and w2[i]==1:
                count +=1
        return count

# Using hashtable

```py

        for word in table:
